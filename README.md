A simple basic calculator user interface utilising the tkinter GUI package. This calculator does the main 4 mathematical operations; addition, subtraction, division and multiplication. It accepts both positive and negative integers as well as floating point numbers. It also throws an Error for operations that can't be done such as dividing by 0! There is also a "C" button which clears the screen of any result or input.
